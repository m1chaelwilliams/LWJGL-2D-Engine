# LWJGL 2D Game Engine

Hi, this is a simple 2D engine I've been working on. Right now it has the following features:

- 2D Coordinate System
- Sprite Rendering
- Cropping/Subsurfacing
- Flipping Surfaces
- Scaling Surfaces
- Resizing Surfaces
- Rect Collision System
- Sprite Meta Class
- Font Rendering using a Font Glyph/Atlas

I plan to make this 100% free and open source!

Thanks for stopping by!
